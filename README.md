# PixelArt-Pacman
PixelArt Pacman made full with simple CSS

This is a first little production of several Pacman made as pixel Art. 
I used only simple HTML5 and CSS3 tools. The littles Pacman are made with only position absolute. It is a choice, there are many ways to do it!!
A very simple linear animation adapted to each objects.
